Heyyy!! Rutuja Saharkar here  🙂
My 1st awesome Project : Anemia Detection & Prevention using Machine Learing and Web Development
According to estimates by the World Health Organization, around 25% of the global population suffers from anemia—that is, roughly one in four people. The prevalence, however, is not uniform across all groups and regions. For instance:

- **Pregnant Women:** The prevalence can be higher, often ranging between 29% to 38% depending on the region.
- **Children (especially preschool-aged):** Some regions report rates as high as 42%.

These variations depend on factors like nutritional status, healthcare access, and socioeconomic conditions.
so I created an unique model using RandomForestClassifier providing us an accuracy of 98.50%   
RandomForest classifiers are often preferred for health monitoring for several key reasons:
1) Robustness Through Ensemble Learning
2) Handling Complex and High-Dimensional Data
3) Feature Importance Insights
4) Robustness Against Missing Data
5) Ease of Use and Versatility
RandomForest generally requires less parameter tuning and is user-friendly, making it a practical choice for various health monitoring applications—from disease prediction to patient risk assessment.
While no single model is universally the best, RandomForest’s balance of accuracy, interpretability, and robustness makes it a strong candidate for many health monitoring tasks.

Further I created a WebApp by using Streamlit App who allow me to deploy and provide me with URL [https://detectanemia.streamlit.app/], Streamlit makes my work easier than ever 
ANEMIA SHIELD : DETECT AND PREVENT
My WebApp Contain Multi-pages :
1. Secure Login(can take user credentials but will require admin(my) approval to login as soon as I approve from my side it will get open for that particular user)
2. Home
3. Diagnosis(which takes user input and give result whether person is suffering from anemia or not(normal,mild,moderate,severe) on basis of Hb(Hemoglobin) based on WHO guidlines, and also provide prescription along with preventive measures to cure)
   Here are the WHO Hemoglobin (Hb) ranges for Normal, Mild, Moderate, and Severe Anemia:
Normal Hb Ranges (WHO Guidelines)
Men: 13.0 – 17.0 g/dL
Women (Non-Pregnant): 12.0 – 15.0 g/dL
Children (6 months – 5 years): 11.0 – 14.0 g/dL
Children (5–12 years): 11.5 – 15.0 g/dL
Adolescents (12–15 years): 12.0 – 16.0 g/dL
Pregnant Women: 11.0 – 14.0 g/dL
Anemia Classification (WHO Criteria)
For Men
Mild Anemia: 11.0 – 12.9 g/dL
Moderate Anemia: 8.0 – 10.9 g/dL
Severe Anemia: < 8.0 g/dL
For Women (Non-Pregnant)
Mild Anemia: 11.0 – 11.9 g/dL
Moderate Anemia: 8.0 – 10.9 g/dL
Severe Anemia: < 8.0 g/dL
For Pregnant Women
Mild Anemia: 10.0 – 10.9 g/dL
Moderate Anemia: 7.0 – 9.9 g/dL
Severe Anemia: < 7.0 g/dL
For Children (6 months – 5 years)
Mild Anemia: 10.0 – 10.9 g/dL
Moderate Anemia: 7.0 – 9.9 g/dL
Severe Anemia: < 7.0 g/dL
For Children (5–12 years)
Mild Anemia: 11.0 – 11.4 g/dL
Moderate Anemia: 8.0 – 10.9 g/dL
Severe Anemia: < 8.0 g/dL
   Output is appearing as :
   🔹 Patient Name: Megha

🔹 Age: 10 | Category: Child | Weight: 30.0 kg

🔹 Hemoglobin: 5.0 g/dL

🔹 Predicted Anemia Condition: Severe Anemia

🩺 Preventive Measures:

🚨 Seek immediate medical attention.

🚨 You may need specialized treatment like transfusions or medications.

🚨 Maintain a high-protein, iron-rich diet with doctor supervision.

💊 Allopathy: Iron Sucrose IV infusion, Erythropoietin injections.

🌿 Ayurveda: Draksharishta (grape-based iron tonic), Mandoor Bhasma.

🍃 Naturopathy: Fresh Aloe Vera juice, Beetroot juice therapy.

🏡 Homeopathy: Ferrum Metallicum 30C (for severe weakness and pallor).

✅ Patient data saved successfully! (for normal,mild,moderate different preventive measures are there)

4. Patient Data (Store Data)
5. Visualization (Anemia Severity Distribution by Pie Graph)
